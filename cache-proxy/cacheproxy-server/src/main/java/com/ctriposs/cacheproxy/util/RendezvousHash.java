/**
 * <p>A high performance thread safe implementation of Rendezvous (Highest Random Weight, HRW) hashing is an algorithm that allows clients to achieve distributed agreement on which node (or proxy) a given
 * key is to be placed in. This implementation has the following properties.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Non-blocking reads : Determining which node a key belongs to is always non-blocking.  Adding and removing nodes however blocks each other</li>
 * <li>Low overhead: providing using a hash function of low overhead</li>
 * <li>Load balancing: Since the hash function is randomizing, each of the n nodes is equally likely to receive the key K. Loads are uniform across the sites.</li>
 * <li>High hit rate: Since all clients agree on placing an key K into the same node N , each fetch or placement of K into N yields the maximum utility in terms of hit rate. The key K will always be found unless it is evicted by some replacement algorithm at N.</li>
 * <li>Minimal disruption: When a node is removed, only the keys mapped to that node need to be remapped and they will be distributed evenly</li>
 * </ul>
